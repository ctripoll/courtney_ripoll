                        My main role at Automotive Development Group involved collecting
                        and inputting data from incoming job applications into an online
                        data source called Taleo. Additionally, I partook in designing and
                        generating company reports based off of the hiring process and job
                        requisitions. In relation to reporting, I took the initiative to
                        develop and design an executable program to automate a specific
                        reporting technique and streamline the process. At the conclusion
                        of my time here, I wrote a manual about my acquired knowledge in the
                        basics of reporting to aid the company in their future endeavors.

                        As a technical mentor, I was responsible for teaching and assisting
                        a group of middle school to high school aged girls while they built
                        a website utilizing HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The girls attended
                        lessons about the technology they we going to use, engaged in making
                        paper prototypes, conducted research on their website topics, and then
                        coded the final product.
